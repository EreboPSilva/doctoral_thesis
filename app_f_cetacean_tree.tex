Marked in \textcolor{myora1}{orange} those specifically referred to in the text and hence used in the comparison studies. Marked with an asterisk are those which annotation is part of the work presented in this thesis, although punctual annotations for specific genes in the rest were also performed. Based in the relations shown by \quotes{Time tree} \cite{Kumar2017}.}
